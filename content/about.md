Hey there! I'm Megan, an undergrad studying CS at MIT. I love all things robots and autonomous systems, and I'm passionate about building safe, smart, and robust systems that solve real-world problems. Some of my current academic and research interests include:

- human-robot interaction
- multiagent systems
- reinforcement learning
- optimization

I also have previous experience with digital twins, synthetic data, computer vision, computational biology, and wet-lab research in an gene therapy / virus lab.

On campus I'm a...
